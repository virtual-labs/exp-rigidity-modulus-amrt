## Assignment



<ol>
  <li>Calculate the rigidity modulus of copper having radius 3 mm fixed on a pulley with radius 5 cm. The whole experiment is carried out by choosing Earth as the environment.</li>
  
  <li>An aluminum rod having radius 4 mm is fixed on a pulley with radius 6 cm. Calculate the rigidity modulus of the material using the simulator. Choose Saturn as the environment.</li>
  
  <li>Calculate the rigidity modulus of brass having radius 3.5 mm fixed on a pulley with radius 5.5 cm. The whole experiment is carried out in Jupiter.</li>
  
  <li>What happens to the value of rigidity modulus when the radius of the copper rod is increased from 4 mm to 5 mm? The radius of the pulley is 7 cm and the experiment is to be performed on the Moon.</li>
  
  <li>An iron rod having radius 4 mm is fixed on a pulley with radius 6 cm. Calculate the rigidity modulus of the material using the simulator. Choose Uranus as the environment.</li>
